Today We discussed the projects provided by the professor. We went through all the topics and talked about every details for each project. Based on our interests, we finaly picked out topic 5 and topic 8.(Refer to <a href="http://zhuguanyu.github.io/fundamental_of_network/documents/CSE534Projects.pdf" style="color:blue">Projects</a>). Then we found our professor, and talked with her to know what these two projects do. At last, we all took the topic 8(mailing list outage) as our project topic.
