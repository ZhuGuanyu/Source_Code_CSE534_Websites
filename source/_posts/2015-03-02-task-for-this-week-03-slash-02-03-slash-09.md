Today is our team regular meeting.    
In this meeting, we arrage the detail tasks for this week. In this week, we will try to complete the first two steps of **Data Preprocessing**. 

* Collate threads.    
  We have contacted with the author of our reference paper, one of Phd students in our university, he shared with us some experience about this project and give us some guide, here we want to say thanks for him. We will classify these dataset at the level of threads. 
  
* Remove spurious data and stop-words
  In this part, we will firstly try to learn some basic tools. 
  What's we need to learn: _SMART information retrieval system, Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, tf-idf_. After that, we need try to remove spurious data and stop-words(e.g., articles, prepositions and pronouns).
