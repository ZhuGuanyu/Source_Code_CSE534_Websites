Today We submitted <a href="http://zhuguanyu.github.io/fundamental_of_network/documents/proposal.pdf" style="color:blue">our proposal</a>. But we still had some problems about this project. 

Questions about the real-time

* Outage mail is sent in real-time by someone? 
* If the outage is recovered right now, so what should I do for the diagnostic in this situation? 
* whatâ€™s the meaning of real-time.

This project is based on this Paper <a href="http://zhuguanyu.github.io/fundamental_of_network/documents/PAM2015.pdf" style="color:blue">Internet Outages, the Eyewitness Accounts: Analysis of the Outages Mailing List</a>.
